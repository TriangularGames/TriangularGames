ðŸ‘‹ Hallo~, Iâ€™m @TriangularGames (pronouns She/They)

Iâ€™m interested in games (casual, VN, slice of life, sappy stuff), anime + manga, general code based suffering.
I've been dabbling in Ren'Py recently, though my main stay is using Unity/C#


Fun fact: Sometimes I get so inspired by random things I can write 5000 words in a single day...except it rarely ever happens for my own projects :'(
