- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TriangularGames
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games (casual, VN, slice of life, sappy stuff), anime + manga, general code based suffering
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ren'Py
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/They
- âš¡ Fun fact: Sometimes I get so inspired by random things I can write 5000 words in a single day...except it rarely ever happens for my own projects :'(
