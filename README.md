ðŸ‘‹ Hallo~, Iâ€™m @TriangularGames (pronouns She/They)

Iâ€™m interested in games (casual, VN, slice of life, sappy stuff), anime + manga, general code based suffering.
I've been dabbling in Ren'Py recently, though my main stay is using Unity/C#

If you'd like to check out any of my projects in action, you can find them on my Itch.io page below!
